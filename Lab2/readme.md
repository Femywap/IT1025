## Executive Summary 
Thischapter covers the hardware part of the computer system that can physically be touch.  A personal computer is made up of many components, most importantly the CPU, motherboard, RAM, hard disk, removable media, and input/output devices.

## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory :memory card is used primarily for storage, while hard drive performs calculations on the data retrieved from storage
#### Latency and Transfer Rates: Latency is the amount of time it takes for data to travel from one point to another. While Bandwidth is the rate of data transfer for a fixed period of time, typically referred to in terms of Megabits per second and Gigabits per second.

#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives: performs the same basic function as a hard drive, but data is instead stored on interconnected flash-memory chips that retain the data even when there's no power flowing through them.

#### Random Access Memory

### ALU and the Control Unit

### CPU, Input & Output

### Logic Gates 
computer use logic game to transform the 1s and 0s from input wires. A logic gate accepts inputs and then outputs a result based on their state

### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
A Vision for Prioritizing Human Well-being with Autonomous and Intelligent Systems 

## Data Representation
Binary code goes by 2. You square root up to 7 like 2^2, 2^3, etc. so you get 128,64, 32, 16,8,4,2, and 1. if you want to make 192 into binary, subtract 128 and I got 64 and then did 64 minus 64. (11000000) this is what i got. to the opposite brig down 128 and 64 and add it. second one is 181 and i got 10110101.


### Hexadecimal Color Representation
Hex is a 6-digit, 24 bit, hexidecimal number that represents Red, Green, and Blue. An example of a Hex color representation is #123456, 12 is Red, 34 is Green, and 56 is Blue
