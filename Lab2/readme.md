## Executive Summary 
Thischapter covers the hardware part of the computer system that can physically be touch.  A personal computer is made up of many components, most importantly the CPU, motherboard, RAM, hard disk, removable media, and input/output devices.

## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory :memory card is used primarily for storage, while hard drive performs calculations on the data retrieved from storage
#### Latency and Transfer Rates: Latency is the amount of time it takes for data to travel from one point to another. While Bandwidth is the rate of data transfer for a fixed period of time, typically referred to in terms of Megabits per second and Gigabits per second.

#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives: performs the same basic function as a hard drive, but data is instead stored on interconnected flash-memory chips that retain the data even when there's no power flowing through them.

#### Random Access Memory
### ALU and the Control Unit
### CPU, Input & Output
### Logic Gates 
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design

## Data Representation
### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal
### Hexadecimal Color Representation
