## Python IDLE
The shell is the UNIX/Linux command line, and a shell script is a file which is executed that contains (basically) the same commands which might be entered on the command line.
A file edictor like Vim for example, is the software which allows you to easily create and change the file which contains all those commands. If you’re familiar with Windows Notepad, you’ve seen an editor

## Code Examples

### Assignment statement:
### Function:
### Three data types:

## Graphics

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
  When you view a raster image at its original size or smaller, the pixels are invisible—they're just too small to see. They only become apparent when you zoom in or make the image larger. graphics are quite different from raster. You can make them any size, big or small, without losing quality.
  
### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression :lossless image compression means all the data from the original file is preserved. Lossy compression, on the other hand, removes some data from the original file and saves the image with a reduced file size.
  
### File Formats
   JPEG’s big advantages is that it allows the designer to fine-tune the amount of compression used
  The PNG format was largely unsupported by Internet Explorer for a long time, making it less commonly used than GIF and JPEG formats, though it’s now supported properly by every major browser.
 GIF: One of the biggest advantages to the GIF format is that it allows for animated images, something neither of the other formats mentioned here allow.
