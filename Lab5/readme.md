## Introduction to Networking

### Data Transmission
#### Packet:The fundamental unit of data transmitted over the Internet
#### Packet-Switching:Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 
#### IP Address:Every device on the Internet (personal computer, a tablet, a smartphone, etc.) is assigned a unique identifying number

#### DNS:DNS stands for “domain name server or system.” DNS acts as the directory of websites on the Internet.

#### Protocol:A protocol is the set of rules that govern how communications take place on a network. For example, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) are the communication rules for transferring files from one host to another. 

### Networking Hardware: a switch is the connection point for the computers (and other devices) in a network. However, a switch is more efficient at passing along traffic.
Router is also more intelligent and sophisticated to serve as an intermediate destination to connect multiple area networks together. A switch is only used for wired network, yet a router can also link with the wireless network
#### Switch vs. Hub: Hub connect all the network devices together on a internal network. A switch can locate the physical IP addres of computer sending data but hub cannot
#### Router vs. Switch and Hub:routers are network endpoints while switches and hubs are not. Switches merely pass the data along to the destination; hubs broadcast it to all connected endpoints, while routers read and process the data in order to determine where it needs to go
### Network Topologies: 
#### Single point of Failure: a flaw in the design, configuration, or implementation of a system, circuit, or component that poses a potential risk because it could lead to a situation in which just one malfunction or fault causes the whole system to stop working.
#### Infrastrucutre vs. Wireless Mesh
### Network Design
### NSA/CSS: NSA Cybersecurity prevents and eradicates threats to U.S. national security systems with a focus on the Defense Industrial Base and the improvement of our weapons’ security.

## Cybersecurity and Encryption

### Information Systems Security

#### Security Triad
Confidentiality: Customers purchase and subscription must be protected. 

Integrity: Restrict access to customers credit card information. No charges on customers CC without consent. 

Availability: Customers Information given to suppliers or logistic companies should be used for its intended purpose. 

#### Authentication; Instead of using one, multi-factor more secure



#### ACL and RBAC: is better suited for implementing security at the individual user level and for low-level data, while RBAC better serves a company-wide security system with an overseeing administrator.

#### Public Key Cryptography :One key (public key) is used to encrypt the plain text to convert it into cipher text and another key (private key) is used by the receiver to decrypt the cipher text to read the message.

### Cryptography
#### Encryption
#### Frequency Fingerprint
#### Polyalphabetic Cipher any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets
#### Polyalphabetic Example:  The Vigenère cipher is the best example

#### Brute-Force is a cryptographic hack that relies on guessing possible combinations of a targeted password until the correct password is discovered.
