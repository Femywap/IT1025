## Introduction to Networking

### Data Transmission
#### Packet:The fundamental unit of data transmitted over the Internet
#### Packet-Switching:Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 
#### IP Address:Every device on the Internet (personal computer, a tablet, a smartphone, etc.) is assigned a unique identifying number

#### DNS:DNS stands for “domain name server or system.” DNS acts as the directory of websites on the Internet.

#### Protocol:A protocol is the set of rules that govern how communications take place on a network. For example, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) are the communication rules for transferring files from one host to another. 

### Networking Hardware
#### Switch vs. Hub: Hub connect all the network devices together on a internal network. A switch can locate the physical IP addres of computer sending data but hub cannot
#### Router vs. Switch and Hub:routers are network endpoints while switches and hubs are not. Switches merely pass the data along to the destination; hubs broadcast it to all connected endpoints, while routers read and process the data in order to determine where it needs to go
### Network Topologies
#### Single point of Failure
#### Infrastrucutre vs. Wireless Mesh
### Network Design
### NSA/CSS

## Cybersecurity and Encryption

### Information Systems Security

#### Security Triad
#### Authentication
#### ACL and RBAC
#### Ciphertext, Public Key and Private Key
#### Public Key Cryptography

### Cryptography
#### Encryption
#### Frequency Fingerprint
#### Polyalphabetic Cipher
#### Polyalphabetic Example

#### Brute-Force
