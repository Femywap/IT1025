## File Compression
 A zip file is a way of grouping, or archiving, multiple files so they act like one file

### Purpose of File Compression
The advantage of zip files is that they are compressed, which means the total file size is smaller. If you're emailing a zip file to someone or posting it to the Web, it takes less time to uploadâ€”and your recipients will also be able to download it more quickly.
