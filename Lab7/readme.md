## File Compression
 A zip file is a way of grouping, or archiving, multiple files so they act like one file

### Purpose of File Compression
The advantage of zip files is that they are compressed, which means the total file size is smaller. If you're emailing a zip file to someone or posting it to the Web, it takes less time to uploadâ€”and your recipients will also be able to download it more quickly.

### Compression and File Size
My file was about 39GB but after compression to file, my file is 39KB.

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Shark Class focuses on creating reusable patterns of code, in contrast to procedural programming, which focuses on explicit sequenced instructions.

### Constructor:
### Class: A blueprint created by a programmer for an object. This defines a set of attributes that will characterize any object that is instantiated from this class.

ObjectAn instance of a class. This is the realized version of the class, where the class is manifested in the program.

## Object Oriented Concepts An object is an instance of a class. We can take the Shark class defined above, and use it to create an object or instance of it.
### Instantiated Objects
### Inheritance
### Encapsulation and Abstraction

## Unified Modeling Language (UML)
